        <h1>Who we are?</h1>
        <p>Have you ever been planning a camping trip for weeks, and an unexpected rain ruined it all? Have you ever
            been on the outdoors, and suddenly a storm leaves you all soaked? Are you the kind of person who likes to
            have everything under control? Well, if your answer to these questions is yes, then Trusty Frog is for you!
            We are here to give you all the weather facts you need to know before planing your activities, and we are
            not talking about all those boring climatological stuff, we are here to say to you: "You know Karen? We know
            you really want to go mountain biking today, but the truth is that it is probable that a storm will hit the
            place you want to go; if you want, we can help you to find other places or activities to do!" And we are not
            only talking about Karen, but this is about you too!</p>
