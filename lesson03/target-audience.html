        <h2>Description</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Outdoors enthusiasts; people who enjoy all kinds of activities in nature (like mountain biking, camping,
            trekking, etc.) These people want to know which will be the weather conditions before they set out on their
            adventures.</p>

        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Persona 1:</strong> Angela is a college student. She is in her mid-twenties and loves all kinds of outdoor activities,
            especially camping. She goes on hikes every week and tries to go camping at least once per month.</p>
        <p><strong>Persona 2:</strong> James is a committed and loving father and husband, and the thing he most enjoys in the world is
            to go mountain biking with his family, he always is planning fun trips with his sons to go on new
            adventures.</p>

        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Angela just found that there is a nice trail near her house and she is planning on going for a
            hike tomorrow morning, she doesn't have classes until 9:00 am, so she will wake up early to go down this new
            trail. She would hate to know that tomorrow morning will be rainy.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> James' son, Mathias, broke his arm a couple of months ago. He couldn't go mountain biking with
            his dad during this time, so they have been planning a cool trip for the last two weeks to celebrate his
            recovery. The thing is that there have been some rains recently, and they want to be prepared.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> Angela will go bike packing next weekend with some friends. The trip will be like 90 miles, so
            she must prepare everything with caution. Because it is a long trip, the weather could change quickly, but
            carrying extra clothing for the rain could make a big difference in the bike's weight. She wants to know if
            the extra-weight will worth it.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario 4:</strong> James and his family are visiting a new bike park, which is just 3 hours from home. It just
            started raining hard, and the trip is starting to feel like a waste of time. James remembers that he can go
            to TrustyFrog.com and look if there are other close places to ride where the weather is better; indeed,
            there is another place where they can ride, and the weather is way better there.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario 5:</strong> Angela and her friends got caught in a storm while they were hiking. Things are starting to get
            ugly and dangerous, and they are a little bit far from the city. They would like to know if there is a close
            place where they can find shelter while the storm passes.</p>
